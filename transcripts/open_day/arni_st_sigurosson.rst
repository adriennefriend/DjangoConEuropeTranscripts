Árni St. Sigurðsson: Data-driven democracy
==========================================

ÁRNI ST SIGURÐSSON:  My name is Árni St Sigurðsson and I come from Iceland, I have a Bachelor Degree in computer science from Reykjavik.  I have worked at 2 of the 3 largest newspapers in Iceland doing work in general.  I am currently working on my own start up doing some consultations on the freelancing.  My background is mostly development websites and API using tasty py and I think of myself as a programmer although become more intimate with Bashkel(?) and operations I was comfortable with at the time.
	 I'm going to tell you one leg of the development story of democracy in Iceland; there has been an initiative during the last several elections to get candidates for elect office to fill out the standard questionnaire and using that data to fit and auto {inaudible}.  The last decade has seen turmoil sweep Icelandic politics economic catastrophe rocked the country in 2008 and led to a popular protest which ended with the resignation of the majority and an election that shifted the political landscape severely culminating with historic indictment and conviction of the former Prime Minister for not observing laws on - I don't have a translation for it.  It's laws on good government that they're supposed to ensure that ministers do their best.
	 It would not be an overstatement to say the national psyche has been going through a schism.  A change of leadership it's felt is not enough.  A democratic {inaudible} would solve the problems.  Calls for constitutional reform with answered with Athenian style assembly {inaudible} national registry.  The document was to inform a {inaudible} convention to {inaudible} reboot.  So this is in Icelandic I couldn't find the graphic in English but this a word map of the document produced from that meeting.
	 Traditionally we have had 2 sorts of elections in Iceland.  {Inaudible} watered down by party affiliation ... oops ... one should not get too technical!  ... Yeah so it's usual party affiliation, you mark X for a party and it's a simple sort of election.  The constitutional convention also posed to be non-political, not partisan acted, so mostly they didn't interfere, but we had 523 candidates for the 25 positions of the convention and this represents the problem, if there is nothing like the elections they had participated infer for, after complaining of lack of choice for decades too much democracy was perceived as a problem and {inaudible} confusion.  In essence it came down to making an awkward choice of up to 25 individuals from the {inaudible} and we just scrolled through the short bio and position on the constitution and image of candidates of those 523 candidates so you can imagine you know about 50 people, about 20 people very well, you are about to select people who are going to lay the foundation for your democracy, you want to make a good choice but 523 candidates, that's a lot of choice.
	 Opportunity to feed an experiment.  Being one of the most popular news web-sites in Iceland known for hard hitting journalism and having no political slant in its coverage made it a good choice to run it you probably fill out like a scales - this is an example question.  They come in very informed but usually have an odd number of options, 4 or against the proposition.  If your {inaudible} is formed you can measure distances between any 2 profiles by summing-up the difference between each question.
	 A couple of things help the project along.  There was no competition in the space and there was a general consensus politicians should not interfere with anything pertaining to constitutional reform, the size being only {inaudible} made it easy to publish the solution.  4 {inaudible} candidates answered.  That's 6 out of 7.  That's a very good return I think.
	 If we thought about averages then you would assume that about 7 of the list of 25 would not have answered the questionnaire but it turned out that there were only 2.  So, it would seem to be a good strategy for anyone putting forth their name to actually participate.
	 Another assumption we can form from this data is that also I ran a comparison what should the - I'm sorry I lost my trail.  Best I can give us why people {inaudible} not similar in use is name recognition proved a very strong thing, most of the people elected were very known to most Icelanders.  There are sorts of {inaudible} political activism, with wide range of opinions among candidates and most people agreed those elected would represent broadly the will of the electorate.  There is a separate story to be told about the aftermath but the short version is the work progressed quite openly with relatively little interference with the political class circulating a document which got positive response.  The draft was submitted to government and has been a hostage to political class since showing change does not come without its fair share of work.
	 {Inaudible} for presidential elections in 2012.  It's rather unusual for Icelandic politics to see a sitting president being contested.  There are 5 challengers and 2 of them strong contenders.  24 questions focused on the power of {inaudible} ... 160 {inaudible}?  Balloted a fair proportion of the population were reached.  The results were more predicted but there was still this pattern emerging that people would rather have a vote counted for a winner than {inaudible} purely.  There was an anticipation of the 2013 parliamentary elections would be historic, the mixture of apathy hope and fear was typical of conventional media.  Among politicians and population.  Instead of the usual 6 parties to choose from this election put 13 parties {inaudible} each party has to turn in a list of 1890 sponsors to qualify for each district that's 25,000 politically active citizens out of an electorate of {inaudible} there is a {inaudible} party has to get before any votes count towards a seat in Icelandic government.  Any party receiving less than 5 per cent of the vote nationally will not gain a number.  This rule has been criticised for being too exclusionary.  You generally don't get regional slates unless they're recognised as a splinter from a faction with a national relevance.  It poses a challenge to end new party.  We saw indication in presidential election numbers that people would rather have a vote count than vote for their political positions.  All these issues the importance of an election - this time there will be challenges we have not tackled before. The first statistical problem was {inaudible} - elections in Iceland are rather short compared to US a little longer than in the UK liaising with established political parties would be easier and infrastructure is in place and political operative’s season.  A multitude of {inaudible} however could be hard to tackle.  With those data we would still need to run a campaign among the candidates to answer the questionnaire during the height of their campaigning when {inaudible} doing other things.  We featured 63 questions with the option to write additional comments on each question.  We gave the candidates an opportunity to write posts that will be featured on the election front page and answer a more casual set of questions.  {Inaudible} we also hosted some of the more recognised candidates in our editorial room making a news item out of who now have been added to the pool of answered questions.  We also have battle fact that some of the established politicians refused to take part to you due to the media coverage done by {inaudible} remember hard hitting journalism - that's something that actually worked against us there.
	 The stark {inaudible} here is the currently governing parties are the ones least likely to participate in new project and the only parties whose leaders abstain.  The pilots were the first party to have all candidates supply paper and only new candidates to get members to Parliament; 11 per cent of the population voted for a party without getting a representative.  Of those 8.6 per cent vote for parties that have enough national following for election {inaudible} distributing and 5 per cent cap.  It's very ironic more democracy led to less democracy.
	 Instead of discussing the municipal elections of 2014 I want to give a brief overview of my architecture at that time.  If you want to replicate a project like this it would be a good place to start.  Django {inaudible} usual apps and delivers you can do {inaudible} settings and {inaudible} build {inaudible} mostly from the command.  Messiness comes about when apps become independent as they often do in media.  I offered to make an app {inaudible} list of questions, questions with attached answers and texts attached to questions.  This was necessary to be able to have question span municipalities.  {Inaudible} event of having to change question wording and to be able to build a separate representation layer for the questions.  The last feature was not used but any bilingual country would need that.  Each model contained an app field so separate apps could be built to represent each election.  It would be relatively easy to build a new election web app for each election but if I were to take out last run I did I would build the application - building an election app web-site would be a push button affair.  We made a single change in algorithm from the year before.  One {inaudible} decided to check which party best fitted known nothing approach and filled in all the answers as "don't know".  It also worried me that it would be a good strategy for a politician to answer only a handful of questions but how the majority we don't know if they counted for a seal or difference with any voter {inaudible}.  I fought for a default distance of one for any don't know answer irrespective of what position the voter held penalising not taking a stance, this resulted in a candidate calling our office furious with a question: how come I don't agree with myself?  I had to summon my strangest poker face explaining to him 2 people don't know nothing about something indeterminately far from each other but the closest approximation I could come to without being harsh was to say that they probably don't agree.
	 This is probably more politics than any of you expected but most of the time it's the subject matter that makes the pack interesting instead of the other way around.  Voting in a secular democracy is a {inaudible} voters are being drowned in data.  For {inaudible} to empower the citizenry, they need tools to see through the fog.  I encourage you to light a lamp and show some of the way.
	 Thank you.  {Applause}.
NEW SPEAKER:	 Can we say thanks to Arnie and has anyone got any questions about this?  Yes?
NEW SPEAKER:	 You said that the position of the newspaper within Icelandic politics was very neutral.  Is that all you used to make sure people could {inaudible} have it in technical aspects...?...audit what you were doing to slim down a bit more?
ÁRNI ST SIGURÐSSON:  Well, it's more of a culture thing.  At the time at least, this newspaper would have been trusted to not take a stance on politics.  People were mostly unhappy with coverage of rape cases where they sometimes named convicted people.  There was this big case several years ago where a man living in rural Iceland committed suicide on the day that his name was on the front page, so it's hard hitting in that way.  They took a lot of flak or it but kind of vindicated several years later when a lot of men who were boys at the time came forth and confirmed that the guy really was a sleaze ball.  We didn't have to worry about people not trusting the result.  There were a lot of spin-off sites that were using our data to do other things, to do things like raiding each question for the political compass and then doing a graph of where on the scale each party was.
NEW SPEAKER:	 So the data was opened is that accurate?

ÁRNI ST SIGURÐSSON:  Semi-open.  You could actually browse through each candidate's position.  We made it in booble(?) as well.  For anyone that sheared the test the first couple of days the Facebook sharing actually showed how they answered the test so we quickly quit that but - and I was kind of amazed that the government agency for privacy didn't actually contact us and do something.  But that was an honest mistake.
NEW SPEAKER:	 Anyone else with questions?
NEW SPEAKER:	 Do you see technology as being a good force for use for creating a digital town hall?
ÁRNI ST SIGURÐSSON:  Excuse me for a town hall?
NEW SPEAKER:	 Yeah a way for the public to directly engage and drive decision making in a democracy?
ÁRNI ST SIGURÐSSON:  Yes, yes we need this, we need all sorts of projects on democracy and we need funding for people to actually just go ahead and do these projects and publish them not as a Vassall of some company, not as a Vassall of - not as a wage slip, so that more journalists outfits are going to run things like this.  In my opinion technology actually opens a whole new avenue of investigation in democracy.  If you think about representative government we're actually using the worst form possible at the moment.  We're sending someone to Parliament or any elect office for some amount of time and we have no say in what actually he does. So, we need to be able to make a recall, you know, say obviously this representative is not representing us and I actually have an idea.  I mean think about it.  Think about elections.  Think about Facebook.  Why aren't elections Facebook basically? why aren't districts groups of people that collaboratively pick somebody from the group who go to Parliament?  If the representative is not delivering on his or her promises, then the group can just recall it.  I mean, it's relatively simple to do something like this.  You could have a layer.  My favourite idea is something I've been calling an emergent congress, where at the first layer, you have to convince - you'd have to sign up at the national registry for the election, I want to be in Parliament. And you have to then - you are randomly assigned into a district and you need maybe about 10 people and you have to convince them that you are supposed to win this round and progressively you let people from each group meet people from other 10 groups where you also have to convince everybody else that you're the guy who goes to the - and then you finally have something like final decision or something that the whole group can then vote between, I like this guy, I like that guy.  So, if you couple this with recall option what's the probability somebody is going to get chosen who will not do the will of the people?  That's very low.  That's actually you would say non-existent because this will presumably be a prestigious position people will want to keep and they're not going to keep it if the ones that elected them aren't - well, if they're going to issue a recall and that's the end of your term because the probability of you maintaining the position amongst the people that sent you there when you didn't do what they wanted you to do is low.
NEW SPEAKER:  How do you think this can happen in other countries?
ÁRNI ST SIGURÐSSON:  Something like the thing I was doing.
NEW SPEAKER:  Yes in Iceland right.
ÁRNI ST SIGURÐSSON:  The pact behind this is simple.  There are, officially things that are going to bite you, if you do something wrong for example, but basically, the first implementation of this was just a model with each question being a field and form model to collect the research and then it is a matter of having an infrastructure to compare, so, you know, after this talk you should be able to pull together in very simple terms something similar.  So if you want to do it locally, give me your e-mail, I will be in contact.
FROM THE FLOOR:  Thanks.
FROM THE FLOOR:  What about hacking and security, that is usually the main thing when we talk of politics, there seems to be no solution.
ÁRNI ST SIGURÐSSON:  So you are worried about some of the spoofing candidate for example?
FROM THE FLOOR:  Yes.
ÁRNI ST SIGURÐSSON:  Well it is not relevant here, it is relevant in everything we do, we should of course worry about security, we should worry about access controls.  But, it is not a part of this discussion.  It is a part of what we have to do generically for example, we have a pay, actually we have, I am no longer working at the TV so, we had the pay wall.  If the pay wall doesn't work, you know, if people can just smuggle themselves inside the pay wall we have no problem.  That is where you saw the security issue in the first place.
FROM THE FLOOR:  Special problem with security and boarding, you can't mix security and anonymity.  So it is not the same problem as the pay wall.  Because the pay wall I can look back at my payment and I can know if there is my payment but, by default, definition, if you make them the voting public.
ÁRNI ST SIGURÐSSON:  I am not advocating e-voting.  Nothing about this is e-voting, all of this gathering data, filtering data and doing something.

DANIELE PROCIDA:  I think we will have to stop there, thank you for your questions, thank you very much.  (APPLAUSE).
