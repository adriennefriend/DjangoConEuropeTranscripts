Django Under The Hood
=====================

NEW SPEAKER:	 Hi, I am highjacking the schedule for a brief unscheduled lightning talk.  Thank you to Daniel for organising the cr√®che which is allowing me to attend the conference, unfortunately I can't make the lightning talks so I have slotted in here.  So it's back for those who don't recognise my branding what it is Django under the hood.  It's different conference to Djangocon which we ran for the first time last year.  If you were paying close attention to Baptistes keynote you'll be familiar with it.  It's conference aimed at high level Django developers where we get long deep level talks on various areas of Django and other parts of the system.  It was a huge success last year.  We had 100 people come and it sold out quickly, talks went really well, great feedback and I'm pleased to announce we're doing it again this year and we're going to make it bigger, so with a bit of luck you won't have to be so quick on your key board to get a ticket, we're going to make it longer so we're going to have 9 amazing talks every day aunt half, start at lunch time on Thursday, 3 talks on the Thursday then 5 talks on the Saturday and sprints on the Saturday, one of the great things about Django under hood are the prints and we're going to make sure we're there properly this time is we're going to have at least 18 members of the core team who've signed up to say they're going to come already so there is really good ratio between those of you trying to contribute to Django and those who allegedly know what we're on about.  The other things it's going to have is lots of sponsors.  At the moment however we have none so I'm looking at you.  Please come and talk us if you'd like to be involved with sponsoring the event, there are tickets included for sponsors, please talk to myself, Baptiste or anybody else on the team.  I'm also excited to announce a lot of health duel today so hopefully get you excited about what's coming up we'll start with everyone's famous Australian.  Russell Keith Magee is going to give a keynote cryptically entitled once upon a Django.  I don't know what it means either and Jacob Kaplan Moss explaining about how Django gets from a wsgi server to your http request and how it goes back the other way.  We'll have Lacopo Spaletti a core member of the team talking about Django works for it.  Florien a Django core dev and is one of the people who receives your email when you email at security at Django.com to explain what measures we have in Django and how they work.  We're going to have Josh Smeaton who is responsible for the enormous expressions patch that landed at Django under the hood last year.  For those who haven't used 1.8 yet {inaudible} is going to talk about this today and later today.  Following on from her talk yesterday we'll have Ola Sitarska talking about the admin talking about how the admin does things and we'll have James talking about files in Django and how it deals with static files, media files and technical constraints there.  There will be a couple of more talks announced to I'm finalising what's going on.  We'll be in Amsterdam from 5 to 7 November this year tickets approximately 150 euros.  They are likely to sell out fast follow us on fitter find the web-site and look forward to seeing you there thank you very much.  {Applause}.
