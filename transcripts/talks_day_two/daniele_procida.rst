DANIELE PROCIDA:  Good morning everyone for day two of Djangocon Europe, welcome back if you have just arrived welcome to Djangocon.

I just want to remind you about the wellbeing support sessions that we have arranged.  The appointment cards are on that little partition at the back just pull off a post it note and you have got your appointment with the room and the time.  So help yourself to one of those.  The counsellors from the university will be here between 10 and 12 and between two and four.

We had two or three very strong and candied statements made by speakers from this podium yesterday about mental health and wellbeing matters that had affected them personally.

I want to say that I was having a really awful time a few years ago; when I was working for the university I was able to make use of that same counselling service.  It didn't solve my problems for me.  But, it did give me a bit of space and time and a way to think about them which helped, helped me find a way to deal with them without being maddened by them, which is what you can expect from a counselling service.  Nothing is going to solve your problems by itself, but I am glad I did that and if you have been affected by any of the things that other speakers have already talked about in the last couple of days, then, feel free to take that as a first step.

I hope you had a good night's sleep, I did until I had, until my dream and I dreamt that I was running a conference and that there was a code of conduct violation caused by Mick Jagger! Who was writing down lists mocking other peopleâ€™s names and Python code and then I woke up (LAUGHTER).

So maybe I am becoming maddened in a slightly different way.

We talk a lot about community and you have all got a special membership card on your lanyard for the community now, I hereby invest you with the power to induct anyone else into our Pythonic sister and brotherhood, into the international society of Djangonaut, before you go home, get the cards, slip into their wallets, so when they get held up at a border or held up at a nightclub, they can show this, yes please, you are very welcome, so we will scatter them around, take some of them and we are the most inclusive society in the world and let it stay that way.

I am sorry, I meant to show you, there we are.

Take advantage of that.

If you can't find one, come and see one of the volunteers.

I mentioned very briefly that we would like to try to get together people who are working with Django or in Django or and in some way have a project that is aimed at increasing social value or social good.  We will have an informal meeting in here at the back of this room towards the end of the lunch break, so we have got half an hour, tomorrow at 2:00 o'clock, so if your company is doing something, if you have got an idea, if there is a need that you think could be solved with a Django project somehow, we will come and talk, maybe we can set something up that, some kind of umbrella, some kind of framework for organising ourselves and see what comes out of that.

I don't know what will, but at least we will know who we are.

The first thing of course that we might be doing is returning the favour to the counselling service of the university by collaborating with them during the sprints to see if maybe we as Django developers can create something that solves a problem for them, we don't know what that is, but if we talk to them, we will find out.

About to welcome our first keynote speaker of the day, I will let Ola introduce her, thank you, enjoy the day, see us if there is anything that you need.  (APPLAUSE).
