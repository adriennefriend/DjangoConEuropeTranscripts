==========================

Proceedings from DjangoCon Europe 2015.

`Published on Read the Docs <http://djangoconeuropetranscripts.readthedocs.org>`_.

See
https://github.com/evildmp/DjangoConEuropeTranscripts/blob/master/transcripts/contributing/index.rst
for guidance on how the files are structured and how you can contribute to creating the
transcripts.

Once the conference videos have been edited and published by `AOTV <http://aotv.co.uk>`_ the work
to create final versions of the transcripts can begin in earnest.

See also `Joachim Jablon's <https://github.com/ewjoachim/DjangoconSubtitles>`_ start on a project
to turn the transcripts into synchronised video subtitles.
